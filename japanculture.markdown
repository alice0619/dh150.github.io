## What's Japan?

## How Are Japanese People Like?

## Greetings
### Basics
- ***Arigatou gozaimasu***.   
(Thank you very much.)
- ***Sumimasen***.   
(Excuse me.)

### Eating
- ***Itadakimasu***.   
(Before meals, "Thanks for the food." Some even liken it to the religious tradition of saying grace before eating.)
- ***Gochisousama deshita***.   
(After meals, “It was a great deal of work (preparing the meal).” Thus, it can be interpreted in Japanese as “Thank you for the meal.")
