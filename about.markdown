(Data by Japan Tourism Agency "Consumption Trend Survey for Foreigners Visiting Japan 2018")


By the graph above, most foreigners visit Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, or popular spots which are introduced by many guidebooks. This website introduces the spots in Japan where are not famous but worth to visit!

The reason why it is quite a small rate of visitors in Western Japan is because the access isn't as convenient as Tokyo, Osaka, or such urban cities. However, you can get an international drivers license before visiting Japan and you can rent and drive a car!

Though they are not popular, you can find some of them near touristic spots!
