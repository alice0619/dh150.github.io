## How Are Japanese People Like?

## Greetings
### Basics
- Arigatou gozaimasu. (Thank you very much.)
- Sumimasen. (Excuse me.)

### Eating
- Itadakimasu. (Before meals, "Thanks for the food." Some even liken it to the religious tradition of saying grace before eating.)
- Gochisousama deshita. (After meals, “It was a great deal of work (preparing the meal).” Thus, it can be interpreted in Japanese as “Thank you for the meal.")
